      <p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
      internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
      Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...

      <ol>
        <li>You caan understand what is going on 'under the roof'</li>
        <li>Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website</li>
        <li>It's fun!</li>
      </ol>
    
       HTML is cool
      CSS is cooler
      JS is the best </p>

        <h3><b><i> What do you need to create a website? </i></b></h3>

      <p> Not much!

        <ul>
          <li>computer (always a good start)</li>
          <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
          <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
        <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      </div>
